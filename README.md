CF-SandboxSecurity
=======


This was a Scriptlet I Wrote some number of years ago, to assist in Checking for CFTag Restrictions on Shared
Hosting Providers.

This Script Tests and Checks for:

      CFFILE
      CFDIRECTORY
      CFCOLLECTION
      CFCONTENT
      CFEXECUTE
      CFLOG
      CFOBJECT
      CFOBJECTCACHE
      CFREGISTRY


The Functions can always be expanded to check for more restrictions.

Tested on ColdFusion 7-10
Not for use on Railo or Lucee
